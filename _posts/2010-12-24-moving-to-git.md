We have just finished moving our main repositories for Asterisk-Java from Subversion to [git](http://git-scm.com/). We'ld love to see more community contributions and I think our move to git will make them easier than ever before.



We have been using git successfully for a few of our own and some customers' projects over the last year and are very pleased with it. Distributed version control allows everybody to clone our repository and maintain their own forks while still making it very easy to contribute back if you like.



The official repositories for Asterisk-Java are now available at [github](https://github.com/srt):







  * [https://github.com/srt/asterisk-java](https://github.com/srt/asterisk-java
)


  * [https://github.com/srt/asterisk-java-iax](https://github.com/srt/asterisk-java-iax
)




We have taken care to preserve the full history, so you will find everything in git that has been in Subversion before - including tags for previous releases.




P.S. [Here](http://blogs.reucon.com/srt/from-subversion-to-git-8156/) is how we did the migration.
