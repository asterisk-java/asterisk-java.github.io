As most of the users already make use of many new features in 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT it is time to push the final release out of the door. As a first step I've released milestone 2 of 1.0.0 called 1.0.0-m2. Have a look at the [changelog](http://jira.reucon.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10000&styleName=Html&version=10030) to see which bugs have been fixed and which new features are included.

Most notably milestone 2 includes support for the 1.6 series of Asterisk as well as support for [using scripting languages with the FastAGI server](http://blogs.reucon.com/asterisk-java/scripting-support-for-fastagi-466/).

The new release is available as a plain jar and a zip distribution at [http://www.asterisk-java.org/download/1.0.0-m2](http://www.asterisk-java.org/download/1.0.0-m2). You can also browse the [documentation](http://www.asterisk-java.org/1.0.0-m2/) and [javadocs](http://www.asterisk-java.org/1.0.0-m2/apidocs/) online.

Please report back any issues you encounter while using milestone 2 through our [issue tracker](http://jira.reucon.org/browse/AJ). If you like to have a certain feature or bug fix included vote for it.
