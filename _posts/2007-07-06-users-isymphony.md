I thought it might be interesting to see what kind of applications other users of Asterisk-Java are building on top of our library. Therefore we will see a series of blog entries here featuring the products of our users.

[iSymphony](http://www.i9technologies.com/isymphony/) is an easy-to-use, Java-based client/server software for managing phone calls via the Open Source Asterisk platform.



It uses Asterisk-Java to connect to a plain Asterisk server or iPBX, an Asterisk appliance sold by [i9 Technology](http://www.i9technologies.com/). iSymphony consists of a server and a client application both written in Java for platform independence.



A free edition for non-commercial use is available for [download](http://www.i9technologies.com/isymphony/).



Do you also have an interesting project or product that makes use of Asterisk-Java? Let me know and present it here.
