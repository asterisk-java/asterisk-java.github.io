Every year, O'Reilly hosts an open-source conference in Portland, OR, USA, in July. If anyone interested is at the conference, I'll be at Mark Spencer's talk on Thursday at 1:45pm. Stop by and say hello -- I'll be wearing the conference badge with my name on it. I'm always delighted to meet other like-minded Asterisk and Asterisk-Java users.
