Digium has released a first beta of Asterisk 1.4 which is scheduled for October.




It is available from [http://www.asterisk.org](http://www.asterisk.org).




Now its time to review the changes and see what finally made it into the new stable branch of Asterisk and adjust Asterisk-Java accordingly. I hope there won't be too much to add to Asterisk-Java as we already closely followed the development of Asterisk. If all goes well Asterisk-Java 0.3 should be available with full Asterisk 1.4 support short time after the final Asterisk 1.4 release.
