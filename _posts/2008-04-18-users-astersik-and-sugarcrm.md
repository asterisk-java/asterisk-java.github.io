Mauro has published an interesting article about [Asterisk and SugarCRM](http://www.beanizer.org/site/index.php/en/Articles/SugarCRM-and-Asterisk-integration-in-Java-First-steps.html) integration. A swing popup notifies its user on incoming calls and provides additional information about the customer that is retrieved from [SugarCRM](http://www.sugarcrm.com/).



The sample application serves as a good example on how to use Asterisk's Manager API with Asterisk-Java.
