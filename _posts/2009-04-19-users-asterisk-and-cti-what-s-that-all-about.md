Sameh Shaker has posted some [examples](http://smshaker.wordpress.com/2009/03/17/asterisk-and-cti-whats-that-all-about/) of what you can do with Asterisk using the Manager API and Fast AGI. I think it's a good starting point for new users of Asterisk-Java to get some inspiration for their own applications.
