It seems we've hidden the link to our mailing lists a bit too well.



We have two mailing lists:







  * Asterisk-Java Users for users of Asterisk-Java seeking help


  * Asterisk-Java Devel for developers of Asterisk-Java, i.e. the guys enhancing the library code itself. This list not intended to provide support regarding the use of Asterisk-Java.




You can find the subscription details for both lists [here](http://asterisk-java.org/development/mail-lists.html).


You might also be interested in our [Bug Tracker](http://jira.reucon.org) where you can look for known issues, post new bug reports and submit patches.
