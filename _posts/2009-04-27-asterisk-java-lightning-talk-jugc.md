I will give a short presentation of Asterisk-Java (in German) at the [Java User Group Cologne](http://jugcologne.org) (JUGC) on May 29th.



It will be a short overview of what Asterisk-Java can do and how it can be used to add phone support to Java applications. The presentation will have a duration of 5 to 10 minutes and include a small interactive demo that serves as a show case.



The main talk will be about [JSF 2.0 vs Struts 2.1](http://87.230.78.21:8080/display/jugc/2009.05.29+JSF+2.0+vs+Struts+2.1). I would be happy to meet a few Asterisk-Java developers over there.





The slides are available (in German) at [slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/srt/asteriskjava-at-jugc-20090529).
