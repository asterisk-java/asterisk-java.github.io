We have released milestone 3 of Asterisk-Java 1.0.0. Next to a few bug fixes this new milestone makes Asterisk-Java OSGi compliant, adds support for the modern [SLF4J](http://www.slf4j.org/) logging framework and makes debugging easier through [built-in support for network tracing](http://blogs.reucon.com/asterisk-java/built-in-support-for-network-tracing-656/).

You can browse the full [changelog](https://secure.reucon.net/issues/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10110&version=10359) to see which issues have been resolved.

The new release is available as a plain jar and a zip distribution at [http://www.asterisk-java.org/download/1.0.0.M3](http://www.asterisk-java.org/download/1.0.0.M3). You can also browse the [documentation](http://www.asterisk-java.org/1.0.0.M3/) and [javadocs](http://www.asterisk-java.org/1.0.0.M3/apidocs/) online.

The new milestone is also available through Maven:

      <groupId>org.asteriskjava</groupId>
