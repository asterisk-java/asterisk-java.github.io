The Asterisk community is currently defining AMI version 1.4 for Asterisk 12. It looks like they take the chance to clean up the interface and make it more consistent. This will benefit everybody who is building applications that connect to Asterisk via AMI.

If you want to have a look a draft is available in the Asterisk wiki: [AMI 1.4 Specification](https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/AMI+1.4+Specification).

There is the corresponding [review request](https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/2269/) that you can use to provide feedback.
