Patrick has joined our small team of developers and will help us improve the Live API which is the part of Asterisk-Java we will focus on for our 1.0 release:





<blockquote>
While checking for new versions I noticed the "new" Live-API. I am really pleased for that feature. but I miss some things. For example a function to retrieve the logged in/out agents for a queue. My first approach was to extend asterisk-java for my own, but I would like to offer my participation on asterisk java development.

So welcome again, Patrick, and thanks for your support!
