[Justin Grammens](http://localtone.blogspot.com/) has published a great overview of using Asterisk and Groovy with Asterisk-Java showing some real-worl examples.










The presentation is also available from [SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/justingrammens/gumvoip).




You might also want to have a look at Justin's blog [Localtone](http://localtone.blogspot.com/). You'll find lots of information on Asterisk, Ruby and Groovy including the Ruby framework [Adhearsion](http://www.adhearsion.com/) and some screencasts. I recommend his screencast on [how to setup Asterisk](http://localtone.blogspot.com/2008/09/blog-post.html) to any Java or Ruby developer who wants to get started with VoIP and Asterisk.
