Since a few days the first beta of [Asterisk](http://www.asterisk.org/) 1.6.0 is [available for download](http://www.asterisk.org/downloads).



So far, Asterisk-Java seems to work fine with the new release.
  

If you encounter any problems feel free to post a comment, join our [mailing list](http://asterisk-java.org/development/mail-lists.html) or post a [bug report](http://jira.reucon.org).





**Update 2008-01-29:**




...and they followed up with 1.6.0-beta2.




For the 1.4 series they start providing release candidates,  an idea that was discussed on the -dev list before and aims at providing better qualitiy for the final production releases:




<blockquote>
The release candidate for 1.4.18 is only 
available via svn.  It is available for anyone that would like to help test 1.4.18 over the next couple of days before it gets officially released.
</blockquote>




Grab it from [http://svn.digium.com/svn/asterisk/tags/1.4.18](http://svn.digium.com/svn/asterisk/tags/1.4.18).
