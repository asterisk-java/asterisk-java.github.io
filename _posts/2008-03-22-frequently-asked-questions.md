Thanks to Martin we now have a [FAQ section](http://asterisk-java.org/faq) available as part of our documentation.



The FAQ covers the questions we encounter on our [mailing lists](http://asterisk-java.org/development/mail-lists.html) and that we think will be interesting to a more general audience. Please check them before asking questions to make sure you don't ask questions again that have already been answered before.



If you notice anything we've missed feel free to post a comment or join our mailing list and propose your addition.
