Chris Heller has published a series of two blog posts on how to integrate Oracle's [PeopleSoft](http://www.oracle.com/applications/peoplesoft-enterprise.html) with Asterisk using Asterisk-Java.




In [PeopleSoft IVR Integration the easy way](http://blog.greysparling.com/2008/07/peoplesoft-ivr-integration-easy-way.html) he explains how to "initiate a phone call to the end user from PeopleSoft, prompt them for a PIN code, and take action in PeopleSoft depending on whether they were successful or not. This may be used as part of the initial signon process for two-factor authentication of your PeopleSoft users, or you might tie this in with some business logic (e.g. be really sure who is sending off a large wire transfer)."  

Part 2 goes into more detail on how use the integration for 
[two factor authentication](http://blog.greysparling.com/2008/07/peoplesoft-telephony-two-factor.html) with user events.
