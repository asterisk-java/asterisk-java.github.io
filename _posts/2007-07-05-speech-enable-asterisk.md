Steve Prior has ported the sample application of the [LumenVox Speech Engine](http://lumenvox.com/) to Asterisk-Java. His code is now available at the [Asterisk Speech Application Zone](http://lumenvox.com/partners/integrator/digium/applicationzone/projects/javaPizza.aspx).



What do you think about speech-enabled applications? Would you like to see native support for the LumenVox API in Asterisk-Java?
