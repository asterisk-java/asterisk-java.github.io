Andreas Neugebauer's submission to the [snom](http://www.snom.com/) [XML Contest](http://contest.snom.com/) was a conferencing application for Asterisk:





<blockquote>
[XMLConference](http://contest.snom.com/contest/index.php/XMLConference)
uses the Asterisk Manager interface, and shows call-related information on the snom phone display and allows you to interact with these calls.
</blockquote>





XMLConference uses Asterisk-Java's implementation of the Manager API to control Asterisk MeetMe rooms and make them available to the snom XML browser. It runs in a standard Java web container like Apache Tomcat.
